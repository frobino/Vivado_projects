Vivado_projects
===============

A repository for some of my Vivado projects targeting Xilinx FPGAs

my_first_microblaze
===============

A simple microblaze system.

TODO:
The repo structure is still not fully portable beacuse it uses a
pre generated bd file. I would like to write tcl that builds the
bd, see the heterogeneous system example.
